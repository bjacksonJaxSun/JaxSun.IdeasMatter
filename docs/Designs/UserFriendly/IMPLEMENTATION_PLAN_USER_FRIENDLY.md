## Development Workflow with Mock Validation

### Mock-First Development Process
Each phase follows this validation workflow:

1. **Mock Creation** → Create interactive mockups/prototypes
2. **User Testing** → Test with target audience (business beginners)
3. **Feedback Integration** → Incorporate user feedback
4. **Implementation** → Build the validated features
5. **Validation** → Test implemented features against mockups
6. **Golden Rule** → Build validation and error resolution

This ensures we don't build features that intimidate or confuse our target users.
