# Script Consolidation Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Consolidated Start/Stop Scripts
**Before**: Multiple duplicate scripts in different folders
- `scripts/dev/start_dev.bat`
- `scripts/dev/startup/start_dev.bat`
- Root `start_dev.bat` (shortcut only)
- Multiple stop scripts in various locations

**After**: Single authoritative scripts in root directory
- `start_dev.bat` - Full Windows batch script
- `start_dev.ps1` - Full PowerShell script
- `stop_dev.bat` - Full Windows batch script
- `stop_dev.ps1` - Full PowerShell script

### 2. Removed Duplicate Folders
- Deleted entire `scripts/dev/` folder structure
- Removed `scripts/dev/startup/` and `scripts/dev/shutdown/` subfolders
- Removed debug and simple variants (consolidated into main scripts)

### 3. Updated Main Scripts
**start_dev.bat improvements**:
- Uses `main.py` directly (more reliable than production_server.py)
- Proper path handling from root directory
- Better error checking for Python/Node.js
- Clear status messages

**stop_dev.bat improvements**:
- Enhanced process cleanup
- Stops processes by both port and window title
- More thorough cleanup of hanging processes
- Better status reporting

### 4. Updated Documentation
- Modified CLAUDE.md to reflect root script locations
- Updated scripts/README.md with new structure
- Updated check_services.bat references

## Benefits

1. **Eliminated Confusion**: No more duplicate scripts in different locations
2. **Simplified Usage**: Just run `start_dev.bat` from root directory
3. **Better Reliability**: Uses main.py instead of production_server.py for fewer path issues
4. **Cleaner Structure**: Scripts are where users expect them (root directory)
5. **Reduced Maintenance**: Only one version of each script to maintain

## New Usage

### Start Development
```bash
# From root directory
start_dev.bat       # Windows Command Prompt
start_dev.ps1       # PowerShell
```

### Stop Development
```bash
# From root directory
stop_dev.bat        # Windows Command Prompt
stop_dev.ps1        # PowerShell
```

### Check Status
```bash
scripts\utils\check_services.bat
```

## Key Fixes

1. **Fixed Python Path Issue**: Scripts now use proper relative paths from root directory
2. **Eliminated WSL Confusion**: Removed problematic path mixing
3. **Simplified Backend Startup**: Uses `main.py` instead of moved `production_server.py`
4. **Better Error Handling**: Scripts provide clearer error messages

The startup issue you experienced should now be resolved since the script uses the correct paths and the standard FastAPI entry point.
