    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> CreateAppointment(CreateAppointmentRequest request)
    
    [HttpPut("{id}")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> UpdateAppointment(string id, UpdateAppointmentRequest request)
    
    [HttpDelete("{id}")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> CancelAppointment(string id)
